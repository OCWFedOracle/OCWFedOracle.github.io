# OCWFed Oracle

This project allows people to search and filter through over 11 years of OCWFed content in ways that were previously impossible. Rather than having to manually search through individual shows and hope to find what you're looking for, with OCWFed Oracle you are able to filter through individual promos through the following categories.

- Promo content
- Show Name
- Date

- **HTML5 / CSS3**: For the core structure and styling of the project.
- **JavaScript**: Enabling dynamic interactions and search capabilities.
